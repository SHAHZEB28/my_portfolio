## About This Project

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website. It is a fully responsive, single-page application designed to showcase my skills, professional experience, and key projects as a full-stack developer. The site is built with modern web technologies and focuses on providing a clean, interactive, and visually engaging user experience.

The entire project was built from scratch using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, and is deployed on Netlify for fast, global access.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Interactive 3D Background:** A dynamic, glowing background effect that follows the user's mouse for a modern, 3D feel.
- **Fully Responsive Design:** The layout is optimized to provide a seamless experience on all devices, from large desktops to small mobile phones.
- **Glassmorphism UI:** Modern, frosted-glass effect on cards and UI elements to create a sense of depth and style.
- **3D Tilt Effect:** Interactive cards that tilt in 3D space based on the user's cursor position.
- **Typing Animation:** The hero section features an engaging, auto-typing subtitle to introduce my key skills.
- **Scroll-Based Animations:** Elements elegantly fade and slide into view as the user scrolls down the page.
- **Netlify-Powered Contact Form:** A fully functional contact form that captures submissions directly through Netlify's built-in service, requiring no backend code.
- **Scrollspy Navigation:** The navigation bar automatically highlights the section currently being viewed by the user.

## üì¶ Setup and Local Development

To clone this repository and run the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/my-portfolio.git](https://github.com/your-username/my-portfolio.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd my-portfolio
    ```
3.  **Run the project:**
    Since this is a static website, you don't need to install any dependencies. You can open the `index.html` file directly in your browser. For the best experience (to avoid any potential CORS issues), use a live server extension.
    - If you are using VS Code, you can install the **"Live Server"** extension and then right-click on `index.html` and select "Open with Live Server".

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment

This project is deployed and hosted on **Netlify**, which is connected directly to the `main` branch of this GitHub repository.

- **Continuous Deployment:** Any push or merge to the `main` branch will automatically trigger a new deployment on Netlify, ensuring the live site is always up-to-date.
- **Netlify Forms:** The contact form is powered by Netlify's built-in form handling.
